# Flight-Arrival-Delay-Prediction

##  Project Overview

The objective of this project is to predict and analyze flight delays through a comprehensive pipeline that encompasses data acquisition, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model development, and evaluation.
By leveraging regression and tree-based models, along with statistical techniques and feature engineering, the project aims to uncover key factors—such as time of day, and flight characteristics—that influence delays.
Our goal is to build accurate, real-world-applicable models that offer actionable insights into flight delay patterns and help optimize performance.

## Stage 1: Data Acquisition

In the first phase of the project, a relevant dataset was selected and downloaded to support the analysis of flight delays.  
This step involved:

- Understanding the dataset structure  
- Identifying key variables  
- Detecting potential issues like missing values or inconsistencies
